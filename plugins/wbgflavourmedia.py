"""
Summary
=======

This intercepts paths like ``/flavour/flav/xyz.css`` and serves up the file 
``xyz.css`` for the flavour ``flav`` located in the flavour dir.  This allows 
flavour packs to be completely self-contained.

wbgflavourmedia only serves up files of the following types:

 * .css - text/css
 * .gif, .jpg, .jpeg, .png - image/...

FIXME - add more types

This plugin is maintained at::

   http://www.bluesock.org/~willg/pyblosxom/

Check that URL for new versions, better documentation, and submitting bug 
reports and feature requests.


Configuration
=============

There is no configuration that needs to be done.  This plugin pretty much 
works right out of the box.

FIXME - add ability to specify additional extensions and mimetypes.
