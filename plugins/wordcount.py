Summary
=======

This is a basic plugin that counts the number of words in each entry
and populates the metadata with that count.

It happens in the cb_story callback, so it only runs for entries that
are about to be rendered.

It counts the words from getData so that it can work on any entry type.

It populates the $wc variable with the word count.

There is no config properties to set up--you can drop this plugin in
and it will work fine.
