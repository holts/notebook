Summary
=======

Provides me with a ``$urlencodedtitle`` which is better for the Google 
link.  It's a urlencoded title.

There's no configuration needed--you can drop this plugin into your
plugin dir and it'll work just fine.

**NOTE:** This plugin is not required if you're using PyBlosxom 1.3 or
later.
