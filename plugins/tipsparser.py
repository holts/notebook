Summary
=======

An entry parser for tips.  It's like the regular txt parser, but does
some minor formatting and has an understanding of a "changelog".  A
"tips" entry would be named something like::

   datadir/pyblosxom/tips/mytip.tips

and would look like this::

   title: my favorite tip
   changelog: v.1.0 (26 January 2004) - initial writing
   body:
      <p>
      This is my fantabulous tip.
      </p>
   
      <pre class="code">
          def look_at_code_snippet_here(foo):
              ...
      </pre>
   

Nothing wildly exciting, but it might be a nice example of a simple
entry parser plugin.

No configuration variables need to be set.  You can just drop
this in and it'll work.
