Summary
=======

This works in conjunction with the comments plugin and allows you to
reduce comment spam by adding a "I am human" checkbox to your form.
Any comments that aren't "from a human" get rejected immediately.

This shouldn't be the only way you reduce comment spam.  It's probably
not useful to everyone, but would be useful to some people as a quick
way of catching some of the comment spam they're getting.


Usage
=====

For setup, copy the plugin to your plugins directory and add it to
your load_plugins list in your config.py file.

Then add the following item to your config.py (this defaults to
"iamhuman")::

   py["nonhuman_name"] = "iamhuman"


Then add the following to your comment-form template just above
the submit button (make sure to match the input name to your
configured input name)::

   <input type="checkbox" name="iamhuman" value="yes"> Yes, I am human!


If you set the nonhuman_name property, then you can do this::

   <input type="checkbox" name="$nonhuman_name" value="yes"> Yes, I am human!


Additionally, the wbgcomments_nonhuman plugin can log when it
rejected a comment.  This is good for statistical purposes.
1 if "yes, I want to log" and 0 (default) if "no, i don't want 
to log".  Example::

   py["nonhuman_log"] = 1


And that's it!
